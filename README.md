# Machine-Learning-SVM-
This gives a detailed explanation of Machine learning, particularly, Support Vector Machine
Data is being produced and sorted continuously ("big data")
Data is not random; it contains structure that can be used to predict outcomes, or gain knowledge in some way.
Example: patterns of Amazon purchases can be used to  recommend items.
Data mining: the application of ML methods to large databases.
Example of ML applications: fraud detection, medical diagnosis, speech or face recognition.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Type of Machine Learning problem
Supervised learning: labels provided
	Classication  (pattern recognition):
		1. Face recognition.
		2. Speech recognition.
		
	Regression: the labels to be predicted are continuous:
		1. Predict the price of a car from its mileage.
		2. Navigating a car: angle of the steering.
 		3. kinematics of a robot arm:
